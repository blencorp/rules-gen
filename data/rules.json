            "Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.",
            "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.",

            "Code for the Maintainer",

            "You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development.\nKey Principles\n- Write clear, technical responses with precise Django examples. - Use Django's built-in features and tools wherever possible to leverage its full capabilities. - Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django's coding style guide (PEP 8 compliance). - Use descriptive variable and function names; adhere to naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for functions and variables). - Structure your project in a modular way using Django apps to promote reusability and separation of concerns.\nDjango/Python\n- Use Django’s class-based views (CBVs) for more complex views; prefer function-based views (FBVs) for simpler logic. - Leverage Django’s ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance. - Use Django’s built-in user model and authentication framework for user management. - Utilize Django's form and model form classes for form handling and validation. - Follow the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern strictly for clear separation of concerns. - Use middleware judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.\nError Handling and Validation\n- Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms. - Use Django's validation framework to validate form and model data. - Prefer try-except blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and views. - Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to improve user experience and provide helpful information. - Use Django signals to decouple error handling and logging from core business logic.\nDependencies\n- Django - Django REST Framework (for API development) - Celery (for background tasks) - Redis (for caching and task queues) - PostgreSQL or MySQL (preferred databases for production)\nDjango-Specific Guidelines\n- Use Django templates for rendering HTML and DRF serializers for JSON responses. - Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling. - Use Django's URL dispatcher (urls.py) to define clear and RESTful URL patterns. - Apply Django's security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention). - Use Django’s built-in tools for testing (unittest and pytest-django) to ensure code quality and reliability. - Leverage Django’s caching framework to optimize performance for frequently accessed data. - Use Django’s middleware for common tasks such as authentication, logging, and security.\nPerformance Optimization\n- Optimize query performance using Django ORM's select_related and prefetch_related for related object fetching. - Use Django’s cache framework with backend support (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load. - Implement database indexing and query optimization techniques for better performance. - Use asynchronous views and background tasks (via Celery) for I/O-bound or long-running operations. - Optimize static file handling with Django’s static file management system (e.g., WhiteNoise or CDN integration).\nKey Conventions\n1. Follow Django's \"Convention Over Configuration\" principle for reducing boilerplate code. 2. Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development. 3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and maintainability.\nRefer to Django documentation for best practices in views, models, forms, and security considerations."

            "Writing code is like giving a speech. If you use too many big words, you confuse your audience. Define every word, and you end up putting your audience to sleep. Similarly, when you write code, you shouldn't just focus on making it work. You should also aim to make it readable, understandable, and maintainable for future readers. To paraphrase software engineer Martin Fowler, \"Anybody can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\"",
            "As software developers, understanding how to write clean code that is functional, easy to read, and adheres to best practices helps you create better software consistently.",
            "This article discusses what clean code is and why it's essential and provides principles and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.",
            "What Is Clean Code?",
            "Clean code is a term used to refer to code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It was made popular by Robert Cecil Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, who wrote \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" in 2008. In this book, he presented a set of principles and best practices for writing clean code, such as using meaningful names, short functions, clear comments, and consistent formatting.",
            "Ultimately, the goal of clean code is to create software that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and efficient throughout its lifecycle.",
            "Why Is Clean Code Important?",
            "When teams adhere to clean code principles, the code base is easier to read and navigate, which makes it faster for developers to get up to speed and start contributing. Here are some reasons why clean code is essential.",
            "Readability and maintenance: Clean code prioritizes clarity, which makes reading, understanding, and modifying code easier. Writing readable code reduces the time required to grasp the code's functionality, leading to faster development times.",
            "Team collaboration: Clear and consistent code facilitates communication and cooperation among team members. By adhering to established coding standards and writing readable code, developers easily understand each other's work and collaborate more effectively.",
            "Debugging and issue resolution: Clean code is designed with clarity and simplicity, making it easier to locate and understand specific sections of the codebase. Clear structure, meaningful variable names, and well-defined functions make it easier to identify and resolve issues.",
            "Improved quality and reliability: Clean code prioritizes following established coding standards and writing well-structured code. This reduces the risk of introducing errors, leading to higher-quality and more reliable software down the line.",
            "Now that we understand why clean code is essential, let's delve into some best practices and principles to help you write clean code.",
            "Principles of Clean Code",
            "Like a beautiful painting needs the right foundation and brushstrokes, well-crafted code requires adherence to specific principles. These principles help developers write code that is clear, concise, and, ultimately, a joy to work with.",
            "Let's dive in.",
            "1. Avoid Hard-Coded Numbers",
            "Use named constants instead of hard-coded values. Write constants with meaningful names that convey their purpose. This improves clarity and makes it easier to modify the code.",
            "Example:",
            "The example below uses the hard-coded number 0.1 to represent a 10% discount. This makes it difficult to understand the meaning of the number (without a comment) and adjust the discount rate if needed in other parts of the function.",
            "Before:",
            "def calculate_discount(price):",
            "discount = price * 0.1 # 10% discount",
            "return price - discount",
            "The improved code replaces the hard-coded number with a named constant TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT. The name instantly conveys the meaning of the value, making the code more self-documenting.",
            "After:",
            "def calculate_discount(price):",
            "TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1",
            "discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT",
            "return price - discount",
            "Also, If the discount rate needs to be changed, it only requires modifying the constant declaration, not searching for multiple instances of the hard-coded number.",
            "2. Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names",
            "Choose names for variables, functions, and classes that reflect their purpose and behavior. This makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand without extensive comments. As Robert Martin puts it, “A name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.”",
            "Example:",
            "If we take the code from the previous example, it uses generic names like \"price\" and \"discount,\" which leaves their purpose ambiguous. Names like \"price\" and \"discount\" could be interpreted differently without context.",
            "Before:",
            "def calculate_discount(price):",
            "TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1",
            "discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT",
            "return price - discount",
            "Instead, you can declare the variables to be more descriptive.",
            "After:",
            "def calculate_discount(product_price):",
            "TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1",
            "discount_amount = product_price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT",
            "return product_price - discount_amount",
            "This improved code uses specific names like \"product_price\" and \"discount_amount,\" providing a clearer understanding of what the variables represent and how we use them.",
            "3. Use Comments Sparingly, and When You Do, Make Them Meaningful",
            "You don't need to comment on obvious things. Excessive or unclear comments can clutter the codebase and become outdated, leading to confusion and a messy codebase.",
            "Example:",
            "Before:",
            "def group_users_by_id(user_id):",
            "The comment about the function is redundant and adds no value. The function name already states that it groups users by id; there's no need for a comment stating the same.",
            "Instead, use comments to convey the \"why\" behind specific actions or explain behaviors.",
            "After:",
            "def group_users_by_id(user_id):",
            "\"\"\"Groups users by id to a specific category (1-9).",
            "Warning: Certain characters might not be handled correctly.",
            "Please refer to the documentation for supported formats.",
            "Args:",
            "user_id (str): The user id to be grouped.",
            "Returns:",
            "int: The category number (1-9) corresponding to the user id.",
            "Raises:",
            "ValueError: If the user id is invalid or unsupported.",
            "\"\"\"",
            "This comment provides meaningful information about the function's behavior and explains unusual behavior and potential pitfalls.",
            "4. Write Short Functions That Only Do One Thing",
            "Follow the single responsibility principle (SRP), which means that a function should have one purpose and perform it effectively. Functions are more understandable, readable, and maintainable if they only have one job. It also makes testing them very easy. If a function becomes too long or complex, consider breaking it into smaller, more manageable functions.",
            "Example:",
            "Before:",
            "def process_data(data):",
            "This function performs three tasks: validating users, calculating values, and formatting output. If any of these steps fail, the entire function fails, making debugging a complex issue. If we also need to change the logic of one of the tasks, we risk introducing unintended side effects in another task.",
            "Instead, try to assign each task a function that does just one thing.",
            "After:",
            "def validate_user(data):",
            "def calculate_values(data):",
            "def format_output(data):",
            "The improved code separates the tasks into distinct functions. This results in more readable, maintainable, and testable code. Also, If a change needs to be made, it will be easier to identify and modify the specific function responsible for the desired functionality.",
            "5. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or Logic",
            "Avoid writing the same code more than once. Instead, reuse your code using functions, classes, modules, libraries, or other abstractions. This makes your code more efficient, consistent, and maintainable. It also reduces the risk of errors and bugs as you only need to modify your code in one place if you need to change or update it.",
            "Example:",
            "Before:",
            "def calculate_book_price(quantity, price):",
            "return quantity * price",
            "def calculate_laptop_price(quantity, price):",
            "return quantity * price",
            "In the above example, both functions calculate the total price using the same formula. This violates the DRY principle.",
            "We can fix this by defining a single calculate_product_price function that we use for books and laptops. This reduces code duplication and helps improve the maintenance of the codebase.",
            "After:",
            "def calculate_product_price(product_quantity, product_price):",
            "return product_quantity * product_price",
            "6. Follow Established Code-Writing Standards",
            "Know your programming language's conventions in terms of spacing, comments, and naming. Most programming languages have community-accepted coding standards and style guides, for example, PEP 8 for Python and Google JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript.",
            "Here are some specific examples:",
            "Java:",
            "Use camelCase for variable, function, and class names.",
            "Indent code with four spaces.",
            "Put opening braces on the same line.",
            "Python:",
            "Use snake_case for variable, function, and class names.",
            "Use spaces over tabs for indentation.",
            "Put opening braces on the same line as the function or class declaration.",

            "Version control systems meticulously track every change made to your codebase, enabling you to understand the evolution of your code and revert to previous versions if needed. This creates a safety net for code refactoring and prevents accidental deletions or overwrites. Use version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to track changes to your codebase and collaborate effectively with others."

Each element of this array will be an instance of the region structure defined in step 1. Initialize this grid with default values for all parameters, ensuring a consistent starting state. Consider implementing methods to easily resize the grid and maintain the aspect ratio with the underlying soup cells.",
            "3. Implement Soup Cell to Region Mapping:",
            "Develop a system to efficiently map each soup cell to its corresponding region. This mapping is crucial for quick lookups during simulation. Create a separate array where each element represents a soup cell and contains the index or reference to its associated region. Implement functions to update this mapping whenever the region grid size changes. Ensure that this mapping system is optimized for performance, as it will be frequently accessed during the simulation.",

            "8. Create a Region Visualization System:",
            "Develop a robust visualization system for the regions. This should:",
            "a. Visually represent the various parameters of each region, possibly using color coding, patterns, or overlays.",
            "b. Update in real-time as parameters are changed, providing immediate feedback to the user.",
            "c. Implement different visualization modes to focus on specific parameters or overall region states.",
            "d. Ensure that the visualization is clear and distinguishable from the underlying soup cell simulation.",
            "9. Implement Data Synchronization:",
            "Create an efficient system for keeping the region grid data synchronized between the JavaScript UI and the WASM simulation. This might involve:",
            "a. Implementing periodic updates at set intervals.",
            "b. Creating an event-driven synchronization system that updates when changes occur.",

            "a. Passing region data to the shader, either as a texture or uniform array.",

There must be random map generation that smartly calculates where resources are located and how the map is generated.\nThe player does not control anything in the game the player is simply an observer, therefore there should be logs for almost everything in the game and it should be turn based.\nAll nations should operate the same, their capabilities should be balanced. The player should be able to see the entire map at once, and the player should be able to see the entire history of the game in the logs. There should be a way to zoom in on a specific square to see more detail.\nNations should be able to trade resources with each other. Nations should be able to go to war with each other. Nations should be able to make peace with each other.\nThe time period of the game is constant and there is no technological tree. It takes place in ancient times.\nnations should spawn a minimum distance away from eachother\nthe entire game should be colored ASCII based in terms of graphics\nThere should be neutral land that can be claimed by any nation. Neutral land should be randomly generated each game.\nThere should be a way to view the current owner of a square.
